# OOP and Design Patterns Repository

This repository is a comprehensive resource for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Low-Level Design (LLD) patterns. It includes examples of Structural, Behavioral, and Creational design patterns, as well as samples for key OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.

## OOP Concepts
- **Inheritance**: The ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on many forms, allowing the same method to behave differently depending on the object it is acting upon.

## LLD Case Studies
- **Design a Pen**: A case study that demonstrates the application of OOP principles and design patterns in the design of a pen, showcasing concepts such as encapsulation, modularity, and object collaboration.

## Design Patterns
The repository includes a variety of design patterns categorized by their type:

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
- **Decorator**: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Flyweight**: Supports large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

### Creational Patterns
- **Factory**: Provides an interface for creating objects.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides a way to create families of related or dependent objects.
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Prototype**: Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
